  <p class="begin">We need the simplest and most inexpensive products, prepare them in advance.And using these products step by step from below, you will get unrealistically delicious pies.</p>
  </div>

<div class="step1">
  <hr size="4" noshade color=black>
  <h2 align="left">Step 1</h2>
  <p class="stext1" align="left" ><img src="https://static.1000.menu/res/380/img/content-v2/33/4c/15862/pirojki-s-kartoshkoi-na-drojjax_1603190266_3_max.jpg" height=300px width=400px align="right">
Start by kneading the dough. We will not put any dough, but immediately knead the dough from all the ingredients. First, mix all the "dry" ingredients: flour (about 2 cups), dry yeast, salt and sugar.
Make a well in the flour. Pour half a glass of vegetable oil into dry foods.</p>
</div>

<div class="step2">
  <hr size="4" noshade color=black>
  <h2 align="right">Step 2</h2>
    <p class="stext2" align="right"><img src="https://static.1000.menu/res/380/img/content-v2/33/4c/15862/pirojki-s-kartoshkoi-na-drojjax_1603190266_5_max.jpg" height=300px width=400px align="left">
    Add warm (about 40 degrees) water to the flour. Attention, the water should not be too hot so as not to kill the yeast. Thanks to the warm water, the dough rises very quickly.
    Add the remaining flour and begin kneading the elastic dough. You may need a little more or less flour. The dough should not stick to your hands, but also not be too tough. Cover the dough with a clean towel and leave to rise for literally
    20-30 minutes while the potatoes are boiling for the filling. It is advisable to put the dough next to the stove so that the pairs of potatoes help the dough rise.</p>
</div>
<div class="step3">
  <hr size="4" noshade color=black>
  <h2 align="left">Step 3</h2>
    <p class="stext3" align="left"><img src="https://static.1000.menu/res/380/img/content-v2/33/4c/15862/pirojki-s-kartoshkoi-na-drojjax_1603190266_8_max.jpg"  height=300px width=400px align="right">
      While the dough is rising, add the filling. The filling can be any, so for example, we took potatoes. Peel the potatoes, wash them and boil them in salted water. Then drain the water and mash the potatoes. It is better to do this with a crush.
      Finely chop the peeled onion. Then fry the onion in vegetable oil until golden brown. Season the mashed potatoes with fried onions, stir well. The filling for the pies is ready.</p>
</div>
<div class="step4">

  <h2 align="right">Step 4</h2>
    <p class="stext4" align="right"><img src="https://static.1000.menu/res/380/img/content-v2/33/4c/15862/pirojki-s-kartoshkoi-na-drojjax_1603190266_10_max.jpg"  height=300px width=400px align="left">
    And now we will wrap it up and immediately begin to sculpt pies. Knead the dough with your hands, knead it for about 3-5 minutes. The dough is very pliable and elastic, so we will not use a rolling pin, but we will do everything with our hands, oiled with vegetable oil.
     Place a plate of butter next to you, dip your hands and begin to tear off pieces of the same size from the dough, thus making blanks for future pies.</p>
</div>

<div class="step5">
  <hr size="4" noshade color=black>
  <h2 align="left">Step 5</h2>
    <p class="stext5" align="left"><img src="https://static.1000.menu/res/380/img/content-v2/33/4c/15862/pirojki-s-kartoshkoi-na-drojjax_1603190266_12_max.jpg"  height=300px width=400px align="right">
    Place a frying pan with oil on the stove to heat up. And start sculpting the first pies. Use your hand to shape a piece of dough into a tortilla shape, not necessarily beautiful and even, the pies will still rise, and all the irregularities will disappear.
    Lay out the filling, it should be half the size of the dough. While this is optional, you can add more. Connect the edges of the dough and hold them together in a patty shape. Immediately send it to the frying pan to fry, putting it in the boiling oil seam side down. Sculpt the next pie in the same way.
    You need to do everything very quickly. If you want, you can mold all the pies in advance, and only then fry them.</p>
</div>

<div class="step6">
  <hr size="4" noshade color=black>
  <h2 align="right">Final Step</h2>
    <p class="stext6" align="right"><img src="https://static.1000.menu/res/380/img/content-v2/33/4c/15862/pirojki-s-kartoshkoi-na-drojjax_1603190266_13_max.jpg"  height=300px width=400px align="left">
  The pies have noticeably increased in size during frying. Transfer the finished patties to a paper towel to absorb the excess oil. Bon Appetit!</p>
